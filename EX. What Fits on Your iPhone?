Exercise: What Fits on Your iPhone?

In this exercise, you'll figure out the answer to the timeless question: How much stuff can I fit on my iPhone?

Unlike the previous exercises, no code will be provided. But here are a few things you’ll need to know:

iPhone storage capacity is measured in gigabytes (GB).
The iPhone in question has 8GB of storage.
A gigabyte is about 1000 megabytes (MB).
The phone already has 3GB of stuff on it.
One minute of video takes 150MB of storage.

How many minutes of video will it take to fill the phone?
 Hint: Do all of your calculations in megabytes (MB).

****** ANSWER *****

let valueOneMinute = 150
let capacityFreeIphone = 5000
let cantMinute = capacityFreeIphone / valueOneMinute

//print ("The iPhone can record \(cantMinute) minutes")

//Other solution. I am using the values ​​of the variables declared above.
let capacityIphone = 8000
let capacityBusyIphone = 3000
let totalValue = capacityFreeIphone * valueOneMinute

if (capacityFreeIphone == capacityIphone)
{
    print ("the iphone has its full capacity to record up to \(capacityIphone / valueOneMinute) minutes")
} else {
    
    print ("the iphone has its NOT full capacity to record up to \( capacityFreeIphone / valueOneMinute) minutes")
}
